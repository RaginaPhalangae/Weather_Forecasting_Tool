# Brief Summary of the Project:
This project is a Python script that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to
retrieve and display weather information for a given city. The hand
takes a city name as a command-line argument and makes an API
request to obtain the weather data. It then parses the JSON response to
extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind
speed, weather description, sunrise time, and sunset time.
The script includes a function kelvin_to_celsius_to_fahrenheit to
convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit. The
retrieved weather data is displayed in both Celsius and Fahrenheit
units. 

The script handles potential exceptions, such as unsuccessful API
requests, errors in parsing the JSON response, and missing data fields.
It provides appropriate error messages in cases of exceptions.

To run the script, the user must provide a city name as a command-line argument. If no argument is provided, a message requesting a city
name is displayed

# How to use it:
